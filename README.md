Use cases:
- Build Notifications - Get notified whenever a build completes in Netlify
- IoT Devices - Say, there is a temperature sensor which sends out an event whenever the temperature crosses 30Â°C. This event will trigger a notification.
- Manufacturing - 3D printers take a long time to print an object. It can fire an event that triggers a notification as soon as the print is done.
